# Steganography
This steganography project in Python hides a secret message within an image by modifying the least significant bits (LSB) of pixel values, preserving the image's appearance. Using the Pillow library, it encodes text by converting it to binary and embedding it in pixel data, with bitwise operations to encode and decode hidden messages accurately.
Skills: Python Programming, Data Encoding/Decoding, Image Processing.
Tools: Python, Pillow (PIL), Text Editor/IDE
